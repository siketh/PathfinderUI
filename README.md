Attempt at making an interface to be used while playing the Pathfinder PnP RPG

(This will become more professional as time goes on, just trying to get the idea out there)

This is my first real project after being in school for a few years, open critique is welcome! I'm mostly doing this for 
the sake of learning, but also because I feel it will be a pretty neat tool to use while playing Pathfinder. I'm really 
not sure where I plan on going with it but I'm having a lot fun. I'm open to all suggestions.

The basic idea is that it has a tabbed interface with different functionality between each tab. The main tab is home to
your character sheet, which serves as the base for all calculations that will take place within the program. I'm trying to
focus on one tab at a time, implementing the most core functionality to each tab and then moving on. 

The aim is to speed up the game by cutting out time wasted on manual calculations and all aspects of character management.
All character data is currently stored in Google drive in a spreadsheet. 

Ideas for other tabs are:
  Macro tab, which will let you make custom macros for automating your characters actions. For example, make a macro 
  for a basic attack, so every time you click it, it will roll the dice for your chance to hit and add all necessary 
  bonuses, spitting out the result and saving you the trouble of doing calculations in your head.
  
  Status tab, which will display the state of your characer, buffs, debuffs, crippled limbs, health, location of items
  on your body, etc.
  
  Skill tab, for displaying and mangaging all your skills
  
  (More to come!)
